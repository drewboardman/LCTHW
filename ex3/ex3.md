Formatted String
----------------
  - there isn't much different here than the last exercise, but he does give
    some more info in the video (that isn't in the book)
  - he says that `main` doesn't *technically* require you to have args. He also
    hints that the `*` in `*argv[]` refers to a pointer.

Extra Credit
------------
`printf` escape codes and format sequences
===================
  - *escape codes* are things like `\n` and `\t`
  - *format sequences* are things like `%d` and `%s`
