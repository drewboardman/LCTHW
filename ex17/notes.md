Heap vs Stack
-------------
  - every time you call `malloc()`, that's *heap*
    - everything else is *stack*

### Plan
  1. Get the structures compiling, and just have a fake `main` function
  2. Implement `Address_print`, and then the other Address functions
  3. Get `die` to work
  3. Get `open` to work in little bits
